# mayonnaise.app
Mayonnaise. is an imaginary web application that was created for the sake of trying out NextJS 13.4 and its `app` router.
There is no real back-end database available, meaning that the submitted email __won't__ be stored! Feel free to use a fake/random email to test it out.

## Screenshots

This site was designed and built with the mobile first approach, meaning that the desktop version will have placeholders to fill out the empty space.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
